# Yahtzee
This is a OOP Yahtzee game developed via python
Besides the basic of programming everything I used
in Python is self taught. So I'm constantly coming back and improving the program. If you find any improvements to make, feel free to contact me!

### Task
Build OOP styled Yahtzee game to understand the fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming

### Why?
I initially built this yahtzee game after learning the basics of python, and quickly learned the advantages to working with classes from issues I faced while developing.

### Summary
This is a command line python program and that can be played with any number of players. It follows the typical Yahtzee game. Players enter their name at the start, and take turns rolling dice and picking scores based on their dice rolled. After the number of turns decided at the beginning, a winner will be calculated!
